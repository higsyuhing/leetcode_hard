record interesting questions.. 

84, init

126, there 3 solutions, python is the basic one, then the self-defined structure one, the last is the middle one. 
407, check 1st then 2nd. 
1192, the cycle checking is not easy to be honest.. 
124,329 [option], what the hell is the best solution? tricky speed-up
992,76 check solution, sliding window! 
295, the solution is really interesting! 
218 minor, multiset!! 
239 minor, the other solution..
336 minor, have no idea about it..
68,76,65 engineering work
10,72,97 check this dp solution. all of them. 
1163, impressed!! this is algorithm difference..
214, hmmmmm..check solution..
